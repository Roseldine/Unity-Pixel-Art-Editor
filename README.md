# Unity-Pixel-Art-Editor
When making unity games, I often find myself in the need of a pixel image editor, either for making pixel art, simple level layouts or prototyping. Although there already exist great tools for this purpose, constantly changing programs is a pain and time consuming, and for this purpose, I am creating this tool.

Development will be done in the Development Branch, any considerable usefull changes / updates, will be pushed to the Main branch.

This is a WIP and expect both bugs and undocumented code.

This project heavily uses my Stardrop Tools Framework
